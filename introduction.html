            <h2>Significance of the Indian Constitution</h2>
            <p>
                The Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land, laying down the framework that defines the
                political principles, establishes the structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government
                institutions, and sets out the fundamental rights, directive principles, and duties of citizens. It
                serves as the foundation for India's democratic system, ensuring the protection of individual liberties
                and fostering unity and equality.

            <h2>History and Drafting</h2>
            <p>
                The drafting of the Indian Constitution began in 1946 by the Constituent Assembly of India, which was
                formed following India’s independence movement. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, known as the Father of the Indian
                Constitution, chaired the Drafting Committee. The Assembly took almost three years to draft the
                Constitution, finally adopting it on November 26, 1949. The Constitution came into effect on January
                26, 1950, a date celebrated annually as Republic Day in India.

            <h2>Key Features of the Constitution</h2>
            <p>
                The Indian Constitution is known for its distinctive features that make it one of the most comprehensive
                and unique constitutions in the world. Some of the notable features include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, and Democratic Republic:</strong> India is a sovereign
                    state, free to govern itself without external interference. The Constitution declares India as a
                    socialist and secular nation, ensuring the right to equality for all its citizens.</li>
                <li><strong>Federal System with a Unitary Bias:</strong> India follows a federal structure with
                    distribution of powers between the central and state governments, but it also has unitary elements
                    during times of crisis.</li>
                <li><strong>Fundamental Rights:</strong> The Constitution guarantees fundamental rights that protect
                    citizens’ freedom, equality, and justice.</li>
                <li><strong>Directive Principles of State Policy:</strong> These are guidelines for the state to follow
                    to ensure social and economic democracy.</li>
                <li><strong>Amendability:</strong> The Constitution provides a mechanism for amendments, allowing it to
                    evolve with time to meet the needs of the nation.</li>
            </ul>
